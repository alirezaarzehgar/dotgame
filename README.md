This game is a fun game that I pick for pastime. It's a challenge that could be enjoyable and fun!

Most features of this code:

- Correctness of implementation
- Simplisity
- Security
- Coehision
- Fake player
- Strong input validation

An small project such this should replace to gist. But I want to improve it sometimes on a day of week. This game should be featureful and interesting! Even we can add this game to OpenBSD games XD
